<h1 id="sharing-m3-content-with-partners">Sharing M3 content with Partners</h1>
<p>The proposal is to utilise the Oauth 2.0 standard to share specific pieces of M3 content in a secure way without partner users needing to register with M3.</p>
<p>Principles of approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Partner users do not need to register with M3</li>
<li>Partner users will only have access to specific agreed pieces of content, they are not logging into M3 sites</li>
<li>Agreed set of profile information is shared for reporting purposes, but never enough to personally identify someone</li>
</ul>
