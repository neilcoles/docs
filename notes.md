# Sharing M3 content with Partners

The proposal is to utilise the Oauth 2.0 standard to share specific pieces of M3 content in a secure way without partner users needing to register with M3.

Principles of approach:
* Partner users do not need to register with M3
* Partner users will only have access to specific agreed pieces of content, they are not logging into M3 sites
* Agreed set of profile information is shared for reporting purposes, but never enough to personally identify someone
